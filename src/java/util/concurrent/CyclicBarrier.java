/**
 * A synchronization aid that allows a set of threads to all wait for
 * each other to reach a common barrier point.  CyclicBarriers are
 * useful in programs involving a fixed sized party of threads that
 * must occasionally wait for each other. The barrier is called
 * <em>cyclic</em> because it can be re-used after the waiting threads
 * are released.
 *
 * <p>A {@code CyclicBarrier} supports an optional {@link Runnable} command
 * that is run once per barrier point, after the last thread in the party
 * arrives, but before any threads are released.
 * This <em>barrier action</em> is useful
 * for updating shared-state before any of the parties continue.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample usage:</b> Here is an example of using a barrier in a
 * parallel decomposition design:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class Solver {
 *   final int N;
 *   final float[][] data;
 *   final CyclicBarrier barrier;
 *
 *   class Worker implements Runnable {
 *     int myRow;
 *     Worker(int row) { myRow = row; }
 *     public void run() {
 *       while (!done()) {
 *         processRow(myRow);
 *
 *         try {
 *           barrier.await();
 *         } catch (InterruptedException ex) {
 *           return;
 *         } catch (BrokenBarrierException ex) {
 *           return;
 *         }
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 *
 *   public Solver(float[][] matrix) {
 *     data = matrix;
 *     N = matrix.length;
 *     Runnable barrierAction =
 *       new Runnable() { public void run() { mergeRows(...); }};
 *     barrier = new CyclicBarrier(N, barrierAction);
 *
 *     List<Thread> threads = new ArrayList<Thread>(N);
 *     for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
 *       Thread thread = new Thread(new Worker(i));
 *       threads.add(thread);
 *       thread.start();
 *     }
 *
 *     // wait until done
 *     for (Thread thread : threads)
 *       thread.join();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * Here, each worker thread processes a row of the matrix then waits at the
 * barrier until all rows have been processed. When all rows are processed
 * the supplied {@link Runnable} barrier action is executed and merges the
 * rows. If the merger
 * determines that a solution has been found then {@code done()} will return
 * {@code true} and each worker will terminate.
 *
 * <p>If the barrier action does not rely on the parties being suspended when
 * it is executed, then any of the threads in the party could execute that
 * action when it is released. To facilitate this, each invocation of
 * {@link #await} returns the arrival index of that thread at the barrier.
 * You can then choose which thread should execute the barrier action, for
 * example:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * if (barrier.await() == 0) {
 *   // log the completion of this iteration
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>The {@code CyclicBarrier} uses an all-or-none breakage model
 * for failed synchronization attempts: If a thread leaves a barrier
 * point prematurely because of interruption, failure, or timeout, all
 * other threads waiting at that barrier point will also leave
 * abnormally via {@link BrokenBarrierException} (or
 * {@link InterruptedException} if they too were interrupted at about
 * the same time).
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
 * {@code await()}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions that are part of the barrier action, which in turn
 * <i>happen-before</i> actions following a successful return from the
 * corresponding {@code await()} in other threads.
 *
 * @since 1.5
 * @see CountDownLatch
